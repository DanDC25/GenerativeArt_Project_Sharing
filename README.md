Project written in Advanced Automation at SSIS by Dan

This is my inspiration and how I'd like the results to be.

Update: I found out Artnome isn't a type of generative art but rather a name of a website that publish generative arts. I have found a new type of generative art I found online but does not know the name to it. Here are the pictures.
